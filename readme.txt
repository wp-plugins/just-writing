Adds buttons to the Distraction Free Writing Mode for all kinds of extra functions.

== Description ==

Distraction Free Writing Mode (DFWM) is a great way to focus on writing text, but have you ever found yourself wanting to do a bit more with it?  How about spell check, or change the paragraph style without dropping back to the standard post edit mode?  Now you can get all the functionality of the standard mode tools in DFWM!

But maybe you think there are too many buttons in DFWM, no problem you can get rid of pretty much all of them!

Just Writing takes DFWM from a great way to write to a great way of writing posts!

This plugin adds the following commands to the toolbar in DFWM:

	* Strikethrough
	* Underline
	* RemoveFormat
	* Align Left
	* Align Full
	* Align Right
	* Indent
	* Paragraph
	* H1
	* H2
	* H3
	* H4
	* H5
	* H6
	* Address
	* Preformatted
	* Proofread Writing
	* Insert More Tag
	* Insert custom character
	* Undo
	* Redo
	* Preview

And there's more!

	* Adds a Preview button to the right of the Save button
	* Moves the exit link to the right of the new Preview button as a real button
	* Re-orders the button list to make more sense
	* Per-user preferences for enabling Just Writing
	* Per-user preferences for which buttons to display
